Leaflet.MapboxVectorTile
========================

A Leaflet Plugin that renders Mapbox Vector Tiles on HTML5 Canvas.

## Getting Started

Install the dependencies:

```sh
npm install
```

Dynamically compile and serve:

```sh
npm start
```

This puts a watcher on your source directory and recompiles with browserify automatically. It also serves the project directory on port 3000.

Open your browser to `http://localhost:3000/examples` and see the plugin in action!
